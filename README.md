# Deep Learning Projects Compilation

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Projects Compilation** repository, where I've assembled a collection of projects showcasing my practical implementations of deep learning concepts using TensorFlow. This repository encompasses a variety of projects, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and labs from the MIT Deep Learning course.

## Projects Overview

This repository offers a comprehensive compilation of deep learning projects that span a range of methodologies:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Projects where I've delved into image analysis, object recognition, and other tasks using CNNs.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Implementations that leverage sequential data analysis, text generation, and more using RNN architectures.

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Projects showcasing my exploration of GNNs for tasks involving structured data and graph-based learning.

- **MIT Deep Learning Labs:** Implementations of labs from the MIT Deep Learning course, providing practical exercises for mastering deep learning principles.
